# ReactNewsFeed

The goal for this project is to create a simple NewFeed UI interface similar to facebook/webchat newsfeed
There are three main components/screen:
1. posting feed interface: an interface allowing a user to post text and multimedia
2. news feed view: a screen to display a list of news feed for a user
3. news feed comment: a user can comment on a news feed

Data/Backend will be simulated: please define and create your own networking call to store and retrieve data. You don't need to implement the backend. Simply create mock api calls to return dummy data is enough.

Submission:
Please can a separate PR to submit your design.
